  üí°¬† How it Started

For many, AI was supposed to open the doors of coding. Instead, a gaping lack of context turned it into another wall. We built Aura to tear that wall down.

As developers, we love being in the flow state. But AI coding tools, like Cursor, often break that flow with hallucinations, misunderstandings, or redundant suggestions. We realized this mostly comes from poor or missing context. Writing documentation manually just for AI feels like the opposite of "vibe coding." 

We saw how this lack of context made AI less useful for new coders or those learning. So, we built Aura to fix that: an extension that keeps your AI perfectly in sync with your project, making coding more accessible for everyone.

Forget AI that just guesses. Aura ensures your AI doesn't just process code, but genuinely gets your project, making coding truly accessible and deeply intuitive.

No problem! Here's the "What It Does" section formatted with hashmarks and asterisks, as you requested:

  Inspiration

We were inspired by the real-world stress that healthcare workers face when trying to quickly triage patients in clinics and disaster scenarios. We wanted to create a tool that helps automate part of that judgment process in a safe, accessible way, especially for situations without full hospital infrastructure or around-the-clock staff.

What it does

TriageAI is a lightweight web application that allows users to submit symptoms, upload images, and receive an AI-generated assessment. It returns a suggested urgency level, possible diagnosis, and care advice. The system can also process images using a vision model to support the diagnosis. The entire system works with a Python backend and a modern React (Next.js) frontend.

How we built it

The backend is written in Python using FastAPI and contains the core triage logic, image analysis via OpenAI Vision API, and integration with a MedicalTriageAssistant class that performs rule-based inference. The frontend is built with Next.js and React, featuring a clean UI that allows users to enter symptoms or upload medical images. Axios handles communication between frontend and backend, and all state is managed using hooks.

Challenges we ran into

We faced trouble with CORS settings between the frontend and backend during local development. We also had difficulty managing multiple backends and environment variables, and syncing asynchronous components with dynamic user input. Deploying both parts together smoothly also required troubleshooting.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We built a fully functional AI triage system from scratch in under 24 hours, integrating image input, AI response generation, and multi-route UI with user feedback. We‚Äôre especially proud of combining modern frontend technologies with Python tooling for a clean, accessible healthcare prototype.

What we learned

We learned how to deploy and debug full-stack applications quickly, how to use the OpenAI Vision API for medical-style tasks, and how to keep frontend/backend interfaces minimal but effective. We also practiced Git workflows under stress and made fast architectural decisions.

What's next for TriageAI

We‚Äôd like to connect this to a real database for patient history, add authentication with session persistence, and integrate more robust language translation features for global accessibility. We'd also explore adding offline support and mobile responsiveness to make it usable in more clinics.

### Trashform


Trashform Logo Global recycling crisis stems from the widespread lack of awareness and motivation among the population. This leads to poor waste disposal practices and further contributes towards environmental degradation and many other harmful impacts. However, many individuals remain uninvested because of the absence of personal benefits. Trashform is an AI-powered application that revolutionizes waste management through rigorous image recognition algorithms. Our users can upload their own photographs of waste items or use images online, and our system will classify the material as recyclable, compostable, or general waste. Our system will also determine the environmental impact through carbon footprint analysis and calculate the respective environmental impacts. Users will also receive recommendations for nearby recycling centers and trade-in locations where they can recycle these materials. Our project integrates a modern tech stack combining React with Vite for frontend performance and Tailwind CSS for responsive design implementation. The interface enables image upload functionality that communicates with our backend infrastructure. We also developed a sophisticated machine learning model using Python, training it on a comprehensive Kaggle dataset of over 19,000 classified waste images to achieve precise material classification. Integration between our frontend and backend systems presented significant technical issues, particularly dependency conflicts and package compatibility issues. TensorFlow also had compatibility limitations with the latest version of Python and was unable to render certain parts of our model.

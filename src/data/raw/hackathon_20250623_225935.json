Instead, a gaping lack of context turned it into another wall. We built Aura to tear that wall down.\n\nAs developers, we love being in the flow state. But AI coding tools, like Cursor, often break that flow with hallucinations, misunderstandings, or redundant suggestions. We realized this mostly comes from poor or missing context. Writing documentation manually just for AI feels like the opposite of \"vibe coding.\" \n\nWe saw how this lack of context made AI less useful for new coders or those learning. So, we built Aura to fix that: an extension that keeps your AI perfectly in sync with your project, making coding more accessible for everyone.\n\nForget AI that just guesses. Aura ensures your AI doesn't just process code, but genuinely gets your project, making coding truly accessible and deeply intuitive.\n\nNo problem!

        "description": "<3 You can call this number! <3 You can call this number! <3\n\n---\n\n**Summary**: PETSOS (PET911) is a voice-activated, AI-powered emergency assistant designed to guide pet owners through life-threatening situations for their pets. It simulates a 911-style call, offering hands-free, calm, and intelligent support to navigate crises and facilitate rapid emergency responses.\n\n**Detailed Description**: PET911 functions as a hands-free, voice-activated emergency assistant for pet owners, simulating a 911 call experience for pets. It utilizes a Flask backend orchestrating a modular multi-agent system, including a Triage Agent for rapid assessment, a Memory Agent for contextual continuity, and a Decision Agent for next steps. The core reasoning is powered by Claude, a large language model. Real-time voice input is handled by Vapi, while OpenStreetMap provides location support and Textbelt is used for SMS-based emergency routing to nearby veterinary services.\n\n**Problem Addressed**: The critical absence of a dedicated, immediate, and guided emergency service for pet health crises, leading to panic, delayed action, and potentially tragic outcomes for pets. Pet owners lack a centralized, hands-free resource for 'what to do next' during life-threatening pet emergencies.\n\n**Target Audience**: Pet owners (dogs, cats, etc.) who lack veterinary medical knowledge, are prone to panic in emergencies, and need immediate, clear, and actionable guidance when their pet is in critical condition.\n\n**Commercial Potential**: High\n\n**Innovation Level**: High\n\n**Unique Value**: PET911 offers an immediate, hands-free, and emotionally supportive 'first aid' and routing system for pet emergencies, bridging a critical gap where pet owners currently lack a dedicated, real-time emergency contact similar to human 911.\n\n**Technical Architecture**:\n  - Frontend: Voice-activated interface powered by Vapi for real-time speech-to-text and text-to-speech interaction, enabling hands-free operation.\n  - Backend: A Flask-based backend orchestrating a modular multi-agent system. This system comprises specialized AI agents: a Triage Agent for initial assessment, a Memory Agent for conversational context, and a Decision Agent for determining appropriate actions.\n  - Database: Not explicitly detailed, but the presence of a 'Memory Agent' suggests some form of state management or in-memory context persistence during a call. A dedicated, persistent database for user profiles or call logs was not mentioned for the hackathon scope.\n  - Deployment: Not explicitly mentioned, but typical for a hackathon project would be a local setup or a basic cloud deployment (e.g., Heroku, Render, or a VM).\n  - External_Services: ['Vapi (for real-time voice streaming and interaction)', \"Claude (Anthropic's LLM for core reasoning and instruction generation)\", 'OpenStreetMap (for location services)', 'Textbelt (for sending emergency SMS notifications and routing)', 'Fetch.ai (attempted integration for vet discovery, faced issues)']\n\n**Key Features**:\n  - Voice-activated emergency assistant for pets\n  - Hands-free operation\n  - Simulates 911-style call for pet health crises\n  - Real-time, intelligent, and calm guidance\n  - Triage Agent for rapid emergency assessment\n  - Memory Agent for contextual continuity during calls\n  - Decision Agent for determining next steps and advice\n  - Integration with Claude for core reasoning and instructions\n  - Location support via OpenStreetMap\n  - Emergency vet routing via SMS through Textbelt\n\n**Technical Complexity**: High\n\n**Scalability**: The modular multi-agent system provides a good foundation for scaling agents independently. Flask backend might require containerization (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes) for high traffic. Reliance on external APIs (Vapi, Claude) means scalability will also depend on their limits and pricing models.\n\n**Social Impact**: High\n\n**Potential Reach**: Millions of pet owners globally, especially in regions with high pet ownership and limited immediate emergency pet care access.\n\n**SWOT Analysis**:\n  **Strengths**:\n    - Addresses a crucial and underserved market need.\n    - Highly innovative use of AI, voice tech, and multi-agent systems.\n    - Strong social impact and emotional value proposition.\n    - Hands-free operation is ideal for emergency situations.\n    - Demonstrated ability to integrate complex external APIs.\n  **Weaknesses**:\n    - Hackathon scope means limited robustness and scalability for production.\n    - Reliance on external APIs introduces potential costs, latency, and single points of failure.\n    - Giving 'medical' advice via AI carries significant legal and liability risks.\n    - Prompt engineering for empathy is challenging and requires continuous refinement.\n    - No explicit database mentioned for persistent data, user profiles, or call logs.\n  **Opportunities**:\n    - Large, underserved market of pet owners seeking better emergency support.\n    - Potential for strategic partnerships with pet industry stakeholders.\n    - Expansion into a broader pet health and wellness platform.\n    - Leveraging continuous advancements in AI and voice technology.\n  **Threats**:\n    - Regulatory scrutiny and liability concerns related to providing pet medical advice.\n    - Competition from existing pet care apps or large tech companies entering the space.\n    - Potential for AI 'hallucinations' or incorrect advice leading to negative outcomes.\n    - High operational costs for premium AI and voice APIs at scale.\n    - Data privacy concerns for sensitive user and location information.\n\n**Categories**: healthtech, AI, pet care, emergency services",

We wanted to create a tool that helps automate part of that judgment process in a safe, accessible way, especially for situations without full hospital infrastructure or around-the-clock staff.\n\nWhat it does\n\nTriageAI is a lightweight web application that allows users to submit symptoms, upload images, and receive an AI-generated assessment. It returns a suggested urgency level, possible diagnosis, and care advice. The system can also process images using a vision model to support the diagnosis. The entire system works with a Python backend and a modern React (Next.js) frontend.\n\nHow we built it\n\nThe backend is written in Python using FastAPI and contains the core triage logic, image analysis via OpenAI Vision API, and integration with a MedicalTriageAssistant class that performs rule-based inference. The frontend is built with Next.js and React, featuring a clean UI that allows users to enter symptoms or upload medical images. Axios handles communication between frontend and backend, and all state is managed using hooks.\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\nWe faced trouble with CORS settings between the frontend and backend during local development. We also had difficulty managing multiple backends and environment variables, and syncing asynchronous components with dynamic user input. Deploying both parts together smoothly also required troubleshooting.\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\nWe built a fully functional AI triage system from scratch in under 24 hours, integrating image input, AI response generation, and multi-route UI with user feedback. We‚Äôre especially proud of combining modern frontend technologies with Python tooling for a clean, accessible healthcare prototype.\n\nWhat we learned\n\nWe learned how to deploy and debug full-stack applications quickly, how to use the OpenAI Vision API for medical-style tasks, and how to keep frontend/backend interfaces minimal but effective. We also practiced Git workflows under stress and made fast architectural decisions.\n\nWhat's next for TriageAI\n\nWe‚Äôd like to connect this to a real database for patient history, add authentication with session persistence, and integrate more robust language translation features for global accessibility. We'd also explore adding offline support and mobile responsiveness to make it usable in more clinics.\n\n\n\n        \n    Built With\n\n    axiosexpress.jsfetch-aiflaskjwtmongodbnext.jsnpmopen-aipythontailwind-csstypescriptvercel\n  \n\n        \n    Try it out\n\n    \n        \n  \n  GitHub Repo\n\n    \n  \n\n    \n\n---\n\n**Summary**: TriageAI is a lightweight web application designed to assist healthcare workers in rapidly triaging patients by providing AI-generated assessments based on submitted symptoms and images. It aims to automate parts of the judgment process, particularly useful in scenarios lacking full hospital infrastructure or extensive staff.\n\n**Detailed Description**: TriageAI functions as a web application where users can input patient symptoms and upload medical images.

        "description": "Trashform Logo Global recycling crisis stems from the widespread lack of awareness and motivation among the population. This leads to poor waste disposal practices and further contributes towards environmental degradation and many other harmful impacts. However, many individuals remain uninvested because of the absence of personal benefits. Trashform is an AI-powered application that revolutionizes waste management through rigorous image recognition algorithms. Our users can upload their own photographs of waste items or use images online, and our system will classify the material as recyclable, compostable, or general waste. Our system will also determine the environmental impact through carbon footprint analysis and calculate the respective environmental impacts. Users will also receive recommendations for nearby recycling centers and trade-in locations where they can recycle these materials. Our project integrates a modern tech stack combining React with Vite for frontend performance and Tailwind CSS for responsive design implementation. The interface enables image upload functionality that communicates with our backend infrastructure. We also developed a sophisticated machine learning model using Python, training it on a comprehensive Kaggle dataset of over 19,000 classified waste images to achieve precise material classification. Integration between our frontend and backend systems presented significant technical issues, particularly dependency conflicts and package compatibility issues. TensorFlow also had compatibility limitations with the latest version of Python and was unable to render certain parts of our model.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**: Trashform is an AI-powered application designed to revolutionize waste management by classifying waste items (recyclable, compostable, or general) using image recognition.

        "description": "Analysis Page Landing Page Company Input Analysis Page Landing Page\n\n---\n\n**Summary**: Farsight.fyi is a web application that leverages a hybrid AI system to provide real-time layoff risk scores for companies. It aims to give employees, recruiters, and policymakers foresight into potential mass layoffs by analyzing public data like WARN filings, news articles, and LLM-derived insights.\n\n**Detailed Description**: Farsight.fyi functions as a hybrid AI system designed to assess a company's layoff risk. Upon a user's input of a company name, the system initiates a multi-stage analysis, combining the natural language understanding capabilities of an LLM with the predictive power of a traditional gradient-boosting model. The LLM is primarily used for extracting structured features from noisy, unstructured text data like news articles, which then feeds into the gradient-boosting model to generate an objective layoff-risk score. The frontend is built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind, while the backend leverages FastAPI for integrating the AI pipeline, ensuring a responsive and asynchronous web experience.\n\n**Problem Addressed**: The pervasive issue of mass layoffs feeling like 'out-of-the-blue' events, causing significant distress and economic disruption due to lack of foresight. It addresses the need for proactive intelligence rather than reactive hindsight.\n\n**Target Audience**: Employees (for career planning and job security), Recruiters (for talent acquisition and market insights), Policymakers (for economic monitoring and intervention), and potentially Investors/Analysts.\n\n**Commercial Potential**: High\n\n**Innovation Level**: High\n\n**Unique Value**: Farsight.fyi offers an objective, data-driven foresight into potential mass layoffs, providing valuable lead time for individuals and organizations. Unlike traditional news alerts or financial analysis, it specifically aims to quantify layoff risk through a unique AI-driven approach.\n\n**Technical Architecture**:\n  - Frontend: Built using React and TypeScript, utilizing Vite for fast local development and Tailwind CSS for styling. UI components are sourced from shadcn/ui to streamline development and ensure a modern aesthetic.\n  - Backend: Implemented with FastAPI, serving as the interface between the frontend and the core AI analysis pipeline. It handles real-time requests for company layoff risk assessment and orchestrates the multi-stage AI process.\n  - Database: Not explicitly mentioned for persistent storage of processed company data; the system focuses on real-time analysis by dynamically processing public data. However, temporary storage for intermediate results or caching for performance is implied.\n  - Deployment: Not explicitly mentioned; typically for hackathons, frontend deployments might use services like Vercel/Netlify, and backend on platforms like Render, Heroku, or a simple cloud VM.\n  - External_Services: ['WARN filing data (public records)', 'News rumor data (web scraping/APIs)', \"External LLM APIs (or locally hosted open-source 'tiny' LLMs)\"]\n\n**Key Features**:\n  - Company layoff risk assessment via web application.\n  - Multi-stage, real-time AI analysis.\n  - Utilizes WARN filings and news rumors as input.\n  - Employs LLMs for feature extraction from unstructured text.\n  - Uses gradient boosting models for predictive scoring.\n  - User-friendly React/TypeScript frontend.\n\n**Technical Complexity**: High\n\n**Scalability**: Scaling real-time LLM inferences for many simultaneous requests or for a large number of companies could be a challenge, both in terms of computational resources and cost. Efficient data acquisition and processing for the gradient boosting model would also be crucial.\n\n**Social Impact**: High\n\n**Potential Reach**: The potential reach is global, impacting any sector or region susceptible to economic shifts and mass layoffs. It could serve millions of individuals and thousands of organizations.\n\n**SWOT Analysis**:\n  **Strengths**:\n    - Clear and impactful problem statement (lack of foresight for layoffs).\n    - Innovative hybrid AI architecture combining LLMs with traditional ML.\n    - Strong potential for positive social impact.\n    - Uses readily available public data sources.\n    - Modern and robust frontend/backend tech stack (React, FastAPI).\n  **Weaknesses**:\n    - Reliance on noisy and diverse textual data requires extensive prompt engineering.\n    - Scalability and cost implications of real-time LLM inference.\n    - Accuracy of predictions depends heavily on data quality and model training.\n    - Ethical considerations around how layoff predictions might be used/misused.\n    - Limited information provided on data storage and robust data pipelines for a production system.\n  **Opportunities**:\n    - Expand data integration to create a more comprehensive risk score.\n    - Commercialization through various subscription and API models.\n    - Partnerships with HR firms, recruiters, and career counseling services.\n    - Applying the hybrid AI approach to other predictive labor market insights.\n  **Threats**:\n    - Difficulty in consistently obtaining clean and reliable public data.\n    - Ethical pushback or 'self-fulfilling prophecy' concerns if predictions affect company reputation.\n    - Competition from larger data analytics or HR tech companies that might adopt similar approaches.\n    - Regulatory changes regarding data privacy or public information access.\n\n**Categories**: HR Tech, AI/ML, Data Analytics, Labor Market Intelligence, Fintech (indirectly, via company health)",
